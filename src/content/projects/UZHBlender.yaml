projectDescription: |
       At the University of Zurich I am teaching a recurring course that lets participants familiarize with the basics of 3D Visualisation. We focus mainly on getting hands-on with Modeling, Texturing and Rendering with Blender. The course takes place in a hybrid setting where watching video tutorials are combined with in-person sessions. With time for experimentation it is ossible to accomodate for the specific interest of the participants, veen beyond the scope of Blender.
