projectDescription: |
  The <strong>Freiheit</strong> exhibit, part of the "Kontroverse Diskurse" project, was featured on the **<a href="https://ms-wissenschaft.de/en/" target="_blank" style="pointer-events: auto; color: black;">MS Wissenschaft</a>** in 2024, exploring the concept of freedom through political language. 
  Visitors contributed personal associations, which were analyzed alongside data from 500,000 texts to showcase diverse interpretations of freedom.<br>
  I was responsible for the visual design of the exhibit, creating an engaging and accessible interface to connect visitors with the research.
