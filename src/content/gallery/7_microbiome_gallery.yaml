projectDescription: |
        With the Sustainable Agroecosystems Group at ETH we developed a poster showing the **Soil Microbiome**

        Martin Hartmann instructed the information of the poster with the intent of making it accessible to visitors of OLMA (where it was first shown) but also students at ETH. 
        For more detailed information please visit Hartmanns page:  **<a href="https://www.microbiome.ch/" target="_blank" style="pointer-events: auto; color: black;">microbiome.ch</a>**
