projectDescription: |
  In partnership with the Sustainable Agroecosystems Group at ETH, we developed a visually captivating poster exploring the **Soil Microbiome**. Designed to balance scientific accuracy with visual appeal, this piece aims to make complex microbiological concepts accessible and engaging.
  <br>
  Guided by Martin Hartmann, the poster was crafted to resonate with a broad audience—from curious visitors at OLMA, where it was first showcased, to students at ETH. For more in-depth information, please visit Hartmann’s page:
