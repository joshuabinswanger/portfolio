the Age of Dusk mankind is struggling against the fading flame of humanity In conquest of the last remaining hospitable land various peoples found themselves convergeing in the empire of Caer Ys. An lush green Island thriving on the warm current flowing around it, the People of Ys flourished for centuries Their Prosperity sparked a desire in the fading people from outside culminating in an Age of War. Under constant attackes, the mon and women of Caer Yis were torn apart and thus the Dusk of humanity started to settle in this land too Fion, son to Lochlaught, a God of Perseverance and Bearance of Suffering, rose among his people because of his firay spirit and his godly ancestry. He rallied the späntered remains of the Children of the Eld, another name for the race of Caer Yis The Folk calls him Conqueror of Eld, because he got hold of a part of the elden fire. A primordial force wielded by the Elden Race, ancient beings of this land. It is said, that this was the power the Elden Race manipulated to uphold the alden fim, which gave this island its mild nature and let the Children of Eld prosper Little is known of the Elden Beings, but everyone is certain of their existence. Fion claims to be the descendant of L Lochlaught, a god who served the Elden Ring, the mythical congregation of gods and other beings who upheld the Elden Fire with their ancient powers. His Father passed down his part of the olden fire, when the Ring was shattered at the Beginng of the age of Dusk With the Elden Power of fine, Fion started to reconquer many parts of their ravished homeland. They seemed to be unstoppable on the battlefield. Their fervor was enflamed by Fions presence and the sight of his battle magic let their enemies tremble with fear. Thus it could have been, that all the land would be under Fions rule now, but to his peoples great dispair, he vanished before they could achieve total victory. With the loss of their leader, the opposing forces shattered them once again, and Caer Ys slid into the Darkness agan.","FION dé
